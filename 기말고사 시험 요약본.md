Basic data structures in pandas
Pandas provides two types of classes for handling data:

Series: a one-dimensional labeled array holding data of any type
such as integers, strings, Python objects etc.

DataFrame: a two-dimensional data structure that holds data like a two-dimension array or a table with rows and columns.**
